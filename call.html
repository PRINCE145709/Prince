    <section id="about">
        <h2>About the Universe</h2>
        <p>The universe is an incredible, expansive realm that stretches beyond our understanding. It encompasses everything from the smallest subatomic particles to the most massive galaxies. The universe as we know it began around 13.8 billion years ago with the Big Bang, a moment when space itself began expanding and has continued to grow ever since. This immense space contains galaxies, stars, planets, black holes, and more. As we look further into the cosmos, we begin to grasp the scale of the universe, but we also realize how much more is yet to be discovered. Despite advances in science, there is still much that we don't know about the universe, including the true nature of dark matter, dark energy, and the origins of life itself.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="galaxies">
        <h2>Galaxies: Islands in the Cosmic Ocean</h2>
        <p>Galaxies are vast collections of stars, gas, dust, and dark matter that are held together by gravity. The Milky Way, our home galaxy, is just one of an estimated two trillion galaxies in the observable universe. Galaxies come in various shapes—spiral, elliptical, and irregular—and each one is unique in its structure and the stars that make it up. The Milky Way is a spiral galaxy, and it contains over 100 billion stars, with our Sun being just one of them. Galaxies can collide and merge, forming new and sometimes much larger galaxies. These interactions between galaxies also trigger the formation of new stars and planetary systems. As astronomers observe distant galaxies, they uncover information about the past of the universe, learning more about its evolution and the forces that shape its growth.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="planets">
        <h2>Planets: Worlds Within Reach</h2>
        <p>Planets are rocky or gaseous bodies that orbit stars, and they come in all shapes and sizes. In our Solar System, there are eight planets, including Earth, the only one known to support life. Planets form from the same cloud of gas and dust that surrounds new stars, and their size and composition depend on the conditions of the early Solar System. Some planets, like Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars, are terrestrial—meaning they have solid, rocky surfaces—while others, like Jupiter and Saturn, are gas giants. These gas giants have thick atmospheres and are composed mostly of hydrogen and helium. In recent years, the discovery of exoplanets—planets orbiting stars outside our Solar System—has opened up new possibilities in the search for life elsewhere in the universe. Some of these exoplanets exist in what’s known as the "habitable zone," where conditions might allow for liquid water, and therefore, the potential for life.</p>

    <section id="stars">
        <h2>Stars: The Heart of the Universe</h2>
        <p>Stars are the building blocks of galaxies and the primary sources of light and energy in the universe. They are massive spheres of hot, glowing gas, primarily hydrogen, that undergo nuclear fusion in their cores. This process transforms hydrogen into helium and releases vast amounts of energy in the form of heat and light. The Sun is our closest star and the center of our Solar System, providing the warmth and energy necessary for life on Earth. Stars can vary in size, color, and temperature, with the most massive stars burning much hotter and faster than smaller stars. When stars exhaust their fuel, they undergo dramatic changes, often exploding as supernovae or collapsing into black holes. The death of stars also results in the creation of new elements, which are essential for the formation of planets and life. The lifecycle of stars is an ongoing process of birth, life, death, and rebirth in the cosmos.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="blackholes">
        <h2>Black Holes: The Mystery of the Cosmos</h2>
        <p>Black holes are some of the most enigmatic objects in the universe. They are formed when massive stars collapse under their own gravity at the end of their life cycle. The gravitational pull near a black hole is so strong that not even light can escape from it, which is why they are called "black." Black holes come in various sizes, from small stellar black holes formed from dying stars to supermassive black holes that reside at the centers of galaxies. These supermassive black holes can contain millions or even billions of times the mass of the Sun. Despite their name, black holes are not empty; rather, they are regions of space where matter has been compressed to an incredibly dense point. As we observe black holes, scientists continue to study their effects on the fabric of space-time, as they challenge our understanding of gravity and the nature of the universe itself.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="life">
        <h2>Life Beyond Earth: The Search for Extraterrestrial Life</h2>
        <p>One of the most profound questions humanity faces is whether life exists beyond Earth. The search for extraterrestrial life has captivated scientists, philosophers, and the general public for centuries. The discovery of microbial life on Mars or the discovery of extremophiles—organisms that can live in extreme conditions on Earth—has fueled our curiosity. The exploration of moons such as Europa (one of Jupiter’s moons) and Enceladus (a moon of Saturn) has revealed subsurface oceans that could harbor life. Additionally, the discovery of exoplanets in the habitable zone of distant stars provides hope that other planets may host life as well. While we have not yet found definitive evidence of extraterrestrial life, scientists continue to study the conditions necessary for life to emerge and the possibility of finding it elsewhere in the universe.</p>
